PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH:
    - Understand the problem
    - Explore concrete examples
    - Break it down
    - Solve / simplify
    - Look back and refactor

UNDERSTAND
    1. Restate the problem in own words
    2. What are the inputs?
    3. What are the outputs?
    4. Is information given enough to solve the problem?

EXPLORE
    1. Start with simple examples
    2. Progress to more complex examples
    3. Explore examples with empty inputs
    4. Explore examples with invalid inputs

BREAK
    1. Explicitly write the steps needed to take

SIMPLIFY
    1. Find the core difficulty in your algorithm
    2. Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    3. Write a simplified solution
    4. Get back to the difficulty

REFACTOR
    1. Can you check the result?
    2. Can you solve it differently?
    3. Can you understand the solution at glance?
    4. Can you use the solution for solving other problem?
    5. Can you improve performance of your solution?
    6. How other people solved this problem?
