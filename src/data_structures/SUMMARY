Data structures are collections of values, the relationship among them and the functions/operations tha can be applied to the data.
Different data structures can excel in different situations and for different purposes.

                        INSERTION     REMOVAL     SEARCHING   ACCESS
Singly linked list        O(1)      O(1) / O(n)     O(n)       O(n)
Doubly linked list        O(1)         O(1)         O(n)       O(n)
Stack                     O(1)         O(1)         O(n)       O(n)
Queue                     O(1)         O(1)         O(n)       O(n)
Binary Search Tree        O(log(n))                 O(log(n))

SINGLY LINKED LIST
+ Good choice when insertion and deletion at the beginning is frequently required
- No indexes

DOUBLY LINKED LIST
+ Removing is always constant time
+ Faster in finding nodes (comparing to Singly linked list)
- Takes more memory due to extra 'prev' pointer

STACK
+ Fast insertion/removal (from the beginning of the stack)

QUEUE
+ Fast insertion/removal

BINARY SEARCH TREE
+ Doubling the number of nodes -> only +1 step to find/insert
