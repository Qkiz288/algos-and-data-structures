Persistent priority queue is a extended priority queue data structure with ability to preserve previous version
of itself when it is modified. They can be considered as ‘immutable’ as updates are not in-place.

A data structure is partially persistent if all versions can be accessed but only the newest version can be modified. 
Fully persistent if every version can be both accessed and modified.

Idea implemented in order to get previous versions of the queue is to make every node store its 'version'
label. Additionally, queue is holding historical nodes (removed). Using version and historical nodes, new queue is built and returned.
