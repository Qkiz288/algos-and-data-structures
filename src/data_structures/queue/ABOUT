Queue implementation uses linked list. Array is not efficient due to O(n) time complexity when inserting
in the beginning of the array (reindexing all following items).
Queues supposed to be O(1) when calling enqueue() / dequeue()
Queues are FIFO data structure used for scheduling tasks in order etc.


                     tail
--- ENQUEUE -->     "Item 3"
                        |
                    "Item 2"
                        |
                     head
                    "Item 1"    --- DEQUEUE -->
