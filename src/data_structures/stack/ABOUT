Stack implementation uses linked list. Array is not efficient due to O(n) time complexity when inserting
in the beginning of the array (reindexing all following items).
Stacks supposed to be O(1) when calling push() / pop()
Stacks are LIFO data structure used for functions invocations (call stack), for operations like undo/redo, for routing (back/forward)


                     first
    --- PUSH -->    "Item 3"    --- POP -->
                        |
                    "Item 2"
                        |
                     last
                    "Item 1"
